 *
 * [Aero] is dropped from the fallback as it is much more transparent than [Tabbed] or [Mica] and not customizable as
 * [Acrylic]. If [Tabbed] or [Mica] falls back to [Acrylic] or [Transparent], high alpha is used with white or black
 * color according to `isDarkTheme` to emulate these effects.
